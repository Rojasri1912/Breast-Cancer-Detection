# Breast Cancer Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting breast cancer based on diagnostic data. The goal is to classify tumors as malignant or benign using various machine learning techniques.

## Features
- **Dataset**: Uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which contains diagnostic features extracted from digitized images.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing feature distributions and relationships.
- **Model Building**: Implementing classification models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- **Visualization**: Displaying feature importance and performance metrics.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Google Colab**: For coding and model training.
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for visualization
  - `sklearn` for machine learning algorithms

## Installation & Usage
1. Open the project in **Google Colab**.
2. Load the dataset (can be accessed from sklearn datasets or uploaded manually).
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
4. Experiment with different models and hyperparameters for optimization.

## Expected Outcome
- A machine learning model capable of accurately classifying breast cancer cases.
- Insights into the most important features affecting diagnosis.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing deep learning techniques for improved performance.
- Deploying the model as a web application for real-time detection.
- Incorporating additional patient history data for enhanced predictions.
